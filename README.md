A compact, engineering-focused guide to implementing Zero-Trust API architecture without slowing down developer velocity.  
Includes real code examples (Node.js, Python, Go), schema validation patterns, auth strategies, mTLS setup, rate limiting, correlation IDs, and production-safe security controls.

## 📦 What's Inside

- Zero-trust architectural principles  
- JWT + ABAC/RBAC patterns  
- Input validation with schemas  
- Rate limiting and identity throttling  
- mTLS service-to-service security  
- Correlation IDs for observability  
- Secure secrets management  
- Developer velocity workflow

## 🔐 External Compliance Dependencies

Zero-trust workflows sometimes require external verification.
